# Code Complete

#### Second Edition || By Steve McConnell

## Overview

_Code Complete_ outlines a variety of software construction principles and techniques. Many software professionals hold it in high esteem as a reference for developing well-crafted, easily-maintained systems.

The book covers many aspects of creating high quality software, from high-level architecture design to low-level code formatting. Topics include designing clean and user-friendly APIs, choosing thoughtful names, and performing testing, debugging, and refactoring in structured ways.

These notes are organized by chapter, presenting main points for each subsection, followed by a few of my favorite quotes and distilled "takeaways".

### Summary

#### 1.1 - What is Software Construction?

+ **Construction** activities mostly refer to _detailed design, coding, debugging, and integration/unit testing_
    - The heart of construction is coding and debugging, which the existence and functionality of the final product depends on
+ **Nonconstruction** activities include _problem/requirements definition, software architecture design, system testing, and maintenance_

#### 1.2 - Why is Software Construction Important?

+ Construction is a _large and central part of development_ (and the only part guaranteed to be performed)
+ Good construction techniques can improve developer productivity and code readability


### Quotes

> Requirements specification and design documents can go out of date, but the source code is always up to date.


### Takeaways

+ Informally, construction is "programming" - the central, most essential step in software development
+ Construction does not refer to the preliminary stages of software development (e.g., problem definition), nor the later stages (e.g., maintenance)
+ Doing construction well delivers a variety of benefits throughout the software lifecycle (such as easier maintenance and testing)
