## Book Notes

This repository is a collection of notes I've taken while reading various books about software engineering and how to do it well. I find writing concise, bullet-point summaries aids comprehension. I also like to review the main points and most perceptive quotes from these periodically, to really internalize the concepts.

I hope these notes can serve as a more detailed "table of contents" for anyone interested in these books or their topics, providing an overview or starting point for further study.
